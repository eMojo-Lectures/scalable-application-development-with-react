# scalable-application-development-with-react

Maybe you’ve mastered the technical details of react and are wondering where to go next. Or maybe you’re just looking to start thinking about your applications at a higher level. What ever the case, understanding software architecture at a broader scale could very well help you progress faster in your software development career. Implementing software with robust architecture enables you to scale, test, and maintain your codebase more efficiently. That is, robust architecture is a life saver.

## In this course, we will cover concepts such as:

- Software Architecture,
- Context and Redux,
- Props Drilling and Hoisting,
- Component Life Cycles,
- UI performance issues,
- Database design,
- DRY implementation,
- API services,
