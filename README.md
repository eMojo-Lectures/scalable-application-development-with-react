# Scalable application development with react--MERN Stack.

Maybe you’ve mastered the technical details of react and are wondering where to go next. Or maybe you’re just looking to start thinking about your applications at a higher level. What ever the case, understanding software architecture at a broader scale could very well help you progress faster in your software development career. Implementing software with robust architecture enables you to scale, test, and maintain your codebase more efficiently. That is, robust architecture is a life saver.

This module introduces you to concepts of software development with the MERN stack which will set you off to build relaible, scalable, and robus software interms of its full-stack implementation. The modules herein are structured to take you from intermediat concepts to more advanced concepts in a way that inter-connects the units to one-another. It is important to go through the modules from first to last, because the skills you learn in one module will be ussed in the consiquent modules. 

## Module Guidline:
- Watch every video within a module and be sure to complete the final projects which we provide as an assessment of the knowledge you've gained from the given module.
- Working with a note-book, and taking notes of key concepts in each module will help you concretise what you have learned.
- We use Github classrooms for final assessments for each module. Each module will contain tests for the given knowledge sets which we intend to cover for the module.
- Post questions in the comments section for every module and be sure to enable notifications for when the lecturer response to your query.
- Keep your eye on the live lecture schedules if there are any for your module.

## In this course, we will cover concepts such as:

- Software Architecture,
- Context and Redux,
- Props Drilling and Hoisting,
- Component Life Cycles,
- UI performance issues,
- Database design,
- DRY implementation,
- API services,
- Web workers.
